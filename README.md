# Week1-Tavern_Database
This contains the database framework for my taverns. 
It has tables which track the supplies, sales, employees, owner information, services, building info, and the rats.
To use this, you must first use the SQL to create the tables, then you must use the SQL to insert the key values in, then you may insert the values for each table.
This code works in PHPmyAdmin, MySQL Workbench 6.3 CE, etc.
